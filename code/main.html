					<section id="about">
						<p>I'm a hard-working, dedicated, and passionate person who loves to express myself creatively. I enjoy introducing new ideas to people, whether through work, basic conversation, or storytelling. I usually bring an interesting perspective to most situations that others wouldn't think of, and connecting to people on a personal level in various ways (such as face to face or through my art) is a big bonus for me.</p>

						<p>At the moment, I'm hoping to transition into a job that will allow me to embrace these traits, as well as challenge me and allow me to make a difference in people's lives.</p>
